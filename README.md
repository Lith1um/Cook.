##### To-Dos

- stepped form for uploading recipes
- refactor recipe form to having image upload section be its own widget
- images aren't currently deleted when recipe is
- verify email functionality
  - prevent profile changes until email is verified
- better firebase auth rules
- user profile linked to firebase user
  - display name
  - avatar

- fields to add:
  - servings count


##### Bugs

- flicker of logged out views when first loading a page using the provider
- User only updates when firebase auth changes

##### Nice to have

- create reuseable tabs widget
- offline content?
- build shopping list by selecting multiple recipes
  - tick list to confirm items bought
